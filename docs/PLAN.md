## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

Build a **personal job application tracker** optimized for MAANG-level SDET job hunting.

### Core Goals
- Fast-track applications using pre-filled templates and auto-fill helpers
- Track applications, interviews, outcomes, and interview Q&A per company
- Insights — performance trends, weak areas, success rates
- Job Alerts — monitor job boards via RSS feeds for SDET roles

### Who Uses This
Solo use (localhost primary). Can be deployed to Netlify later for mobile access.

---

## 2. TECH STACK DECISION

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| **Frontend** | React + Vite | Fast dev server, great DX |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui | Production-grade, copy-paste components, dark mode built-in |
| **State** | Zustand | Simpler than Redux, perfect for this scale |
| **Backend/DB** | PocketBase (single binary) | Open-source, self-hosted, REST API, zero config, SQLite |
| **Charts** | Recharts | React-native, declarative, lightweight |
| **Job Alerts** | Node.js cron + RSS feeds | Free, no API key needed |
| **Hosting** | Localhost (primary) → Netlify (optional) | Personal use = no deployment needed |
| **Version Control** | GitHub + GitHub Actions | Automated CI + daily DB backup |

### Why PocketBase over Supabase/Sanity
- Single binary — `./pocketbase serve` — zero config
- Built-in admin UI at `localhost:8090/_/`
- No cloud account needed, SQLite underneath — fast, portable, zero cost
- REST + realtime subscriptions out of the box

## 4. CLAUDE.md SETUP

### How Auto-Updates Work

Claude Code **automatically reads `CLAUDE.md`** at session start. To keep it always current, end every session with:
```
Update CLAUDE.md:
- Mark Sprint [N] done with today's date under SPRINT STATUS
- Append any new decisions under DECISIONS LOG
- Update CURRENT STATE with what's built and what's next
- Update KNOWN ISSUES with any bugs or TODOs
Do NOT delete existing content — only update or append.
Commit: "docs: update CLAUDE.md sprint-N progress"
```

Claude edits section-by-section using the labeled headers as anchors — `CURRENT STATE` is updated without touching `CODE STANDARDS`.

### Split Context Strategy (keeps CLAUDE.md lean)
```
CLAUDE.md            → current state, sprint status, decisions (updated every session)
docs/SCHEMA.md       → full PocketBase schema (stable)
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md → tech decisions (stable)
docs/PLAN.md         → this file — sprint task lists (reference only)
```

Claude Code follows `See docs/SCHEMA.md` references automatically — no need to paste schema into every session.

---

### CLAUDE.md Starting Template

Create this at the project root before Sprint 0. Claude maintains it after each session.
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## ⚡ CURRENT STATE
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-03
**Active Sprint:** Sprint 0
**Last Completed:** None yet
**Next Action:** Run Sprint 0 bootstrap tasks

---

## ✅ SPRINT STATUS
- [ ] Sprint 0 — Bootstrap
- [ ] Sprint 1 — Application CRUD
- [ ] Sprint 2 — Interview Tracker
- [ ] Sprint 3 — Dashboard + Insights
- [ ] Sprint 4 — Job Alerts
- [ ] Sprint 5 — Polish + Export

---

## 📋 DECISIONS LOG
- 2026-03-03: Chose PocketBase over Supabase — zero config, single binary, localhost-first

---

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES
- None currently

---

## 🏗 PROJECT CONTEXT
Personal job application tracker for Manjunath H K (Senior SDET targeting MAANG).
Solo-use app — localhost only. No authentication required.
See docs/PLAN.md for sprint task lists and verification steps.
See docs/SCHEMA.md for PocketBase collection schemas.

---

## 🛠 TECH STACK
- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Backend: PocketBase (localhost:8090)
- State: Zustand | Charts: Recharts
- See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for full rationale

---

## 🔧 CODE STANDARDS
- Functional components with hooks only — no class components
- All PocketBase calls go through /src/services/ only
- Zustand for shared state, useState for component-only state
- Tailwind only — no inline styles, no CSS modules
- shadcn/ui components before building custom ones
- Always wrap async in try/catch — show toast on error
- Never hardcode URLs — use VITE_PB_URL from .env

---

## ▶ COMMANDS
- Start both: npm run dev:all
- Frontend: npm run dev (port 5173)
- Backend: cd pocketbase && ./pocketbase serve (port 8090)
- Push: git add . && git commit -m "feat: x" && git push origin dev

---

## ❌ DO NOT
- No authentication
- No class components
- No separate CSS files
- No hardcoded credentials
- Do not start next sprint until user types 'ok'
```

---

## 5. GITHUB INTEGRATION PLAN

### Pre-Requisite — One-Time Manual Step
```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
# Select: GitHub.com → HTTPS → Login with browser
```

That is the only manual step. Everything after this is Claude Code.

---

### GitHub Setup Prompt (run at end of Sprint 0)
```
GitHub CLI is authenticated. Set up full GitHub integration:

1. Create private GitHub repo 'job-tracker':
   gh repo create job-tracker --private --source=. --remote=origin --push

2. Create .gitignore for Vite + React + PocketBase:
   Ignore: node_modules/, dist/, .env, pocketbase/pb_data/logs/, pocketbase/pb_data/storage/

3. Branch structure:
   - Push initial state to main
   - Create dev branch: git checkout -b dev && git push -u origin dev
   - Dev is the default working branch for all sprints

4. Create .github/workflows/ci.yml:
   - Trigger: push to dev + PRs to main
   - Steps: checkout → Node 20 → npm ci → npm run build

5. Create .github/workflows/backup.yml:
   - Trigger: cron '30 14 * * *' (8PM IST) + workflow_dispatch
   - Steps: checkout with write permissions → git add pocketbase/pb_data/ → commit if changes → push
   - Use GITHUB_TOKEN

6. Create .github/workflows/release.yml:
   - Trigger: push to main
   - Steps: create tag vYYYY.MM.DD → push tag → gh release create with auto notes

7. Commit all workflow files to dev and push
8. Print the GitHub repo URL

My GitHub username is [YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME].
```

---

### Per-Sprint Git Workflow
```bash
# All sprint work stays on dev (Claude Code handles commits automatically)
git checkout dev
# ... Claude builds and commits ...
git push origin dev

# Sprint verified — merge to main via PR
gh pr create --base main --head dev --title "Sprint N: [name]" --body "Verified ✓"
gh pr merge --squash
# main gets one clean commit per sprint + auto-release tag
```

### Commit Convention
```
feat: add interview question bank
fix: application status not persisting after refresh
chore: db backup 2026-03-03
docs: update CLAUDE.md sprint-2 progress
```

---

## 6. FEATURE SPRINTS (AGILE)

### Sprint 0 — Bootstrap (30 min)
**Goal:** Running app skeleton + GitHub wired up

- Create Vite + React project `job-tracker`
- Install: tailwindcss, shadcn/ui, zustand, recharts, react-router-dom, pocketbase, concurrently
- Download PocketBase binary for macOS ARM64 into `/pocketbase`
- Create CLAUDE.md using template from Section 4
- Create docs/ with SCHEMA.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, PLAN.md
- Build Sidebar Layout + 6 empty page shells
- Add `dev:all` concurrently script to package.json
- Run GitHub setup prompt from Section 5 (auth already done)
- Update CLAUDE.md, commit to dev

**✅ Verify:** localhost:5173 loads + sidebar navigation works + PocketBase admin at :8090/_/ + GitHub repo + CI visible in Actions

---

### Sprint 1 — Application Tracking Core (60 min)
**Goal:** Full CRUD for job applications

- Create `applications` collection in PocketBase admin
- ApplicationForm modal (add + edit, all fields from docs/SCHEMA.md)
- ApplicationTable with sorting + filters (status, source, date range)
- Color-coded StatusBadge component
- Application detail side drawer
- Quick-add from JD URL (auto-parse company from domain)
- Add 5 sample applications

**✅ Verify:** Add / edit / delete / filter all work; data persists after refresh

---

### Sprint 2 — Interview Tracker (45 min)
**Goal:** Interview rounds per application + question bank

- Create `interviews` collection in PocketBase
- Interview form linked to application via relation
- Interview rounds timeline in application detail
- Question bank (Q + answer + Easy/Medium/Hard difficulty)
- Company-level consolidated interview history page

**✅ Verify:** Can add rounds and questions; appear under correct application; company history works

---

### Sprint 3 — Dashboard + Insights (45 min)
**Goal:** Visual overview and rule-based suggestions

- Stats cards: Applied, Active Pipeline, Offers, Rejection Rate
- Funnel chart: Applied → Screening → Interview → Offer
- Weekly trend line chart (last 8 weeks)
- Source breakdown (LinkedIn vs Naukri vs Direct vs Referral)
- Rule-based insight panel:
```javascript
responseRate < 20    → "ATS may be filtering resume — check keyword match"
ghostedCount > 5     → "Follow up on applications older than 7 days"
technicalRejects > 3 → "High technical rejection — prioritize DSA practice"
linkedinShare > 80   → "Over-indexed on LinkedIn — diversify to Naukri and direct"
noActivityLast7Days  → "Pace is slow — target 3 new applications today"
```

**✅ Verify:** Stats match actual DB data; charts render; at least 1 insight shows

---

### Sprint 4 — Job Alerts (30 min)
**Goal:** Surface new SDET job listings from RSS automatically

- Create `alerts` collection in PocketBase
- Alert config UI (keyword + source selection)
- RSS feed parser in scripts/job-alert-cron.js
- Job feed on Alerts page (title, company, date, link)
- Save job from feed → auto-creates application with source = "alert"

**Free RSS:**
```
Indeed IN: https://in.indeed.com/rss?q=Senior+SDET&l=Bengaluru
```

**✅ Verify:** Job listings load for "Senior SDET"; saved jobs appear in Applications

---

### Sprint 5 — Polish + Export (30 min)
**Goal:** Production-ready personal tool

- Dark mode toggle (shadcn theme, persisted)
- Export to CSV
- Global search Cmd+K
- Keyboard shortcut N = new application
- Mobile responsive check (375px)
- README 5-step setup guide
- All sprints merged to main via PRs; final GitHub Release created

**✅ Verify:** Dark mode persists; CSV exports correctly; search + shortcuts work; mobile layout OK

---

### Sprint 6 — Hosting + Pipeline (added 2026-03-04)
**Goal:** App accessible from anywhere; zero-downtime pipeline; automated backups + cron

**Architecture:**
- Frontend → **Netlify** (free): auto-deploy from GitHub `main`, SPA redirect, VITE_PB_URL env var
- Backend → **Fly.io** (free tier): PocketBase binary + persistent SQLite volume, Singapore region
- Cron → **GitHub Actions**: `job-alert-cron.yml` daily at 3:00 PM UTC (8:30 PM IST)
- Backup → **GitHub Actions**: `backup.yml` downloads PocketBase backup zip daily, commits to `backups/`

**Files created:**
- `netlify.toml` — build command, publish dir, SPA fallback redirect
- `Dockerfile` — downloads PocketBase Linux AMD64 binary, copies `pb_migrations/`
- `fly.toml` — Singapore region, 256MB VM, scale-to-zero, 1GB volume mount
- `.github/workflows/job-alert-cron.yml` — replaces local crontab
- Updated `.github/workflows/backup.yml` — uses PocketBase `/api/backups` API (zip → commit)
- `docs/HOSTING.md` — full one-time setup guide + maintenance checklist

**GitHub Secrets required:**
`VITE_PB_URL`, `PB_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `PB_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `ADZUNA_APP_ID`, `ADZUNA_APP_KEY`

**✅ Verify:**
- `fly status` → machine running in `sin`
- Netlify URL → app loads, API calls return 200 from Fly.io
- `gh workflow run job-alert-cron.yml` → completes, new listings in Alerts page
- `gh workflow run backup.yml` → `backups/backup-YYYY-MM-DD.zip` committed to repo

---

### Sprint 7+ — Enhancement Roadmap

These are ideas for future sessions. Pick any that are useful.

#### 7a — Email Digest (High value)
**Goal:** Daily email with new job listings so you don't need to open the app
- Use **Resend** free tier (100 emails/day) — simple HTTP API, no SMTP setup
- Add `scripts/send-digest.js` — call after job-alert-cron, summarize new listings
- Add to `job-alert-cron.yml`: run send-digest.js after fetch step
- PocketBase stores email preference; digest shows: title, company, link, published date
- **Effort:** ~2 hours | **Value:** High — mobile-friendly, no app visit needed

#### 7b — AI Interview Prep (High value, MAANG-focused)
**Goal:** Paste a JD → get predicted interview questions with suggested answers
- Add "Prep" tab to ApplicationDrawer (already shows interview timeline)
- Call Claude API (claude-haiku-4-5, cheapest) with JD + role + company
- Prompt: "You are an SDET interview coach. Given this JD, predict the top 10 interview questions across: DSA, system design for testing, behavioral. For each question, provide a strong answer tailored to a Senior SDET candidate."
- Store results in a new `prep_notes` JSON field on the `applications` collection
- **Effort:** ~3 hours | **Value:** Very high for MAANG prep

#### 7c — Resume Version Manager
**Goal:** Upload resume PDFs, tag them per application, track which version gets responses
- Add file upload to ApplicationForm (`resume_version` field currently just text)
- PocketBase supports file uploads natively — store in `applications` collection as a file field
- Show resume thumbnail in ApplicationDrawer with download link
- Track response rate per resume version in Insights page
- **Effort:** ~3 hours | **Value:** Medium — helps optimize resume

#### 7d — Application Status Webhooks (Automation)
**Goal:** Auto-update application status from email/calendar events
- Gmail label watcher (via Gmail API) → detect "Thank you for applying" emails → set status = applied
- Calendar event with company name → set status = interview, add scheduled_date
- Requires OAuth setup (complex) — lower priority
- **Effort:** ~8 hours | **Value:** High long-term

#### 7e — Salary Benchmark
**Goal:** Show market salary ranges alongside each application
- Integrate with Levels.fyi or Glassdoor API (or scrape) for compensation data by company + role
- Show benchmark in ApplicationDrawer: "Google Senior SDET: ₹45-70 LPA (median ₹55L)"
- Helps calibrate salary_range field entries
- **Effort:** ~4 hours | **Value:** Medium

#### 7f — Kanban View
**Goal:** Drag-and-drop Kanban board as alternative to table view
- Add toggle in Applications page: Table view | Kanban view
- Use `@dnd-kit/core` for drag-and-drop (lighter than react-beautiful-dnd)
- Columns: Applied → Screening → Interview → Offer (with Rejected/Ghosted as archive)
- Dragging card updates `status` field via PATCH
- **Effort:** ~4 hours | **Value:** Medium — better visual overview

## 7. MASTER PROMPT FOR CLAUDE CODE

Copy this as your **very first message** when opening Claude Code in the project folder:
```
I want to build a personal job application tracker web app.

Read this plan file completely before doing anything: docs/PLAN.md
(If it doesn't exist yet, create the docs/ folder and I'll tell you to proceed.)

My setup:
- MacBook Air M4 (Apple Silicon / ARM64)
- Node.js and npm installed, Claude Code running
- GitHub CLI installed and authenticated (gh auth login already done)
- Java/Python expert — intermediate JavaScript

WORKFLOW RULES:
1. Read CLAUDE.md at session start — it is the live source of truth
2. One Sprint per session, in order: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
3. After each Sprint:
   a. Update CLAUDE.md (mark done, update state, log decisions)
   b. Commit to dev: "feat: sprint-N complete" and push
   c. STOP — list exact verification steps — wait for me to type 'ok'
4. Log any unplanned decisions in CLAUDE.md DECISIONS LOG

BEGIN Sprint 0 now.
After Sprint 0 tasks are done, also run the GitHub setup from Section 5
(gh auth is already done — skip that step).
```

### Session Resume Template
```
Read CLAUDE.md. Sprint [N-1] is done and committed to dev.
Continue with Sprint [N] — task list is in docs/PLAN.md.
```

---

## 8. TOKEN OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

**1. CLAUDE.md as Memory** — Claude reads it automatically. Never re-explain stack or schema.
Pattern: `"Read CLAUDE.md. Continue Sprint N."`

**2. Split Context Files** — CLAUDE.md stays lean, references docs/SCHEMA.md and docs/PLAN.md.
Claude follows references automatically.

**3. Reference Schema, Never Paste**
```
# Wasteful: "Build form with fields: company text, role text, status select applied/screening/..."
# Efficient: "Build ApplicationForm — use 'applications' schema from docs/SCHEMA.md"
```

**4. Batch Requests**
```
# 3 round trips: "Add company field" → wait → "Add role" → wait → ...
# 1 message: "Build complete ApplicationForm with all fields from docs/SCHEMA.md using shadcn Dialog"
```

**5. Scope File Edits**
```
# Avoid: "Rewrite ApplicationTable to add filtering"
# Use: "In ApplicationTable.jsx, add filter bar above table. Don't change table rendering."
```

**6. /clear Between Sprints** — Clears accumulated token cost from prior sprint context.
Start fresh: `"Read CLAUDE.md. Continue Sprint N+1."`

**7. End-of-Session One-Liner**
```
"Update CLAUDE.md with today's progress. Commit to dev as 'feat: sprint-N'. Push origin."
```

---

## 9. STOP CONDITIONS AND VERIFICATION CHECKPOINTS

**Sprint 0 ✅** localhost:5173 + sidebar works / PocketBase admin at :8090 / `dev:all` starts both / GitHub repo + CI visible / CLAUDE.md committed

**Sprint 1 ✅** Add/edit/delete/filter all work / data persists after refresh / 5+ applications exist

**Sprint 2 ✅** Interview rounds linked to applications / questions with difficulty saved / company history page works

**Sprint 3 ✅** Stat cards match DB counts / funnel + trend charts render / at least 1 insight shows

**Sprint 4 ✅** Job listings load for "Senior SDET" / saving a job creates application / new keyword triggers refresh

**Sprint 5 ✅** Dark mode persists / CSV exports / Cmd+K search works / N shortcut works / mobile layout OK / PRs merged + GitHub Release created

### 🏁 FINAL STOP
All 5 sprints verified. App runs with `npm run dev:all`. All work merged to main. CLAUDE.md complete. README has 5-step setup.

---

## QUICK REFERENCE
```bash
npm run dev:all                          # Start the app
"Read CLAUDE.md. Continue Sprint [N]."  # New session
"Update CLAUDE.md, commit, push."       # End of session
gh pr create --base main --head dev     # Sprint done → PR
gh pr merge --squash                    # Merge to main
```
